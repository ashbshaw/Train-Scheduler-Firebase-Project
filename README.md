# train-scheduler
Firebase project - Train Scheduler

This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates information with Moment.js, which is a magical but slightly confusing tool. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Firebase database is located here: https://ashleys-train-scheduler.firebaseio.com/
