# Train-Scheduler-Firebase Project

This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
